# Full-Stack Starter

Basically, [React Snowpack Tailwind Starter](https://github.com/manavm1990/react-snowpack-tailwind) as [client](client)
and [MEN Starter](https://github.com/manavm1990/men-starter) as [server](server).

## Get Started

1. `cd client`.
2. `npm i; npm start`
3. Open a new terminal instance and `cd server` there.
4. `npm i; npm start`

You now have two terminal instances 🏃🏾‍♂️. One for client and one for server.
